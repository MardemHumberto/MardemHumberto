### ðŸ’¼ About Me

I'm a Senior Data Analyst passionate about turning messy data into practical solutions.  
Here I share personal projects and some of the tools and automations I build to solve real problems from my day-to-day work.

I'm a Control & Automation Engineer by background â€” graduated from the Polytechnic School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Poli USP), ranked among the top 100 universities worldwide.  
My career has taken me through global companies like PepsiCo, MondelÄ“z International, and QuintoAndar (Top 25 Startups globally), where I work on data, automation, analytics, and decision-making challenges.

Although based in Brazil, remote work has always been part of my journey â€” Iâ€™ve supported the Caribbean market in the past and in 2025 Iâ€™ll be heading to Europe as a digital nomad.
Outside of work, I'm a music and travel enthusiast â€” a drummer since as far back as I can remember â€” and someone who has visited many countries. I love multicultural environments and cosmopolitan cities, and I'm open to remote freelance opportunities with companies in the US and Europe.
